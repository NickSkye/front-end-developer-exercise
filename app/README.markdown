Document your submission here (optional, but recommended)
I put together a quick webpage using html and jquery and css describing the baby steps of Dave Ramseys teachings.
you can select the different baby steps and then it displays who else from the ajax response is also on those steps.
The animations are simple as to not take away from the overall user experience.
No SEO has been included because it was not required though I usually like to put at least meta description and keywords.
